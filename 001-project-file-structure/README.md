# 001 - Project File Structure

The Purpose of this example it's to understand how to set up a robust file structure for an Angular Project, [LIFT][1] principles:

* Locating our code is easy
* Identify code at a glance
* Flat structure as long as we can
* Try to stay DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

For More information about Applications Structure [here][2]

# To Do
Perform the following in the current example:
* Create a login page.
* Create a Dashboard page after sign in up.

# Solution

### Folder structure

* First of all, create proper folders for states, their controllers and stylesheets.

### Files inside folders:

* Inside those folders create the view, controller and its corresponding stylesheet, This is for having reusable views totally independent of each other.

### States:

* In this example we used UI-Router which introduces a state machine design pattern abstraction on top of a traditional router. Routes are referred to as states and the URL becomes simply a property of the state.


### Navigation:

* This example uses "ui-sref" for navigation between views where parameters are not required.

* This example uses a different approach for navigation with parameters.

* Using ng-submit directive, call a function inside login controller that handles the transition of views with parameter included.

##### Get parameters:

* Inside dashboard controller, use $stateParams object to get parameters inside the url sent from login view.


### Printing variable in html:

* To print the paremeter sent from login intro dashboard view, use angular expression {{dashboardCtrl.userName"}}.
